    "\n",
    "In this code, there is a shadowing issue. `sum` is a built-in function in Python that sums up the values in a given sequence passed as an argument to it. By creating a new function called `sum`, the built-in method is shadowed, and the interpreter is trying to make a recursive call to the newly redefined function `sum`, which takes 2 arguments. However, only 1 argument is provided in the invocation on line 5, resulting in a required positional argument TypeError.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the fix is to rename the function to something that is not a built-in method. Something like `mulitiply_sum` seems to be a good fit:"
