    "The issue with the code as written is that string is not an empty string when the for loop is on the first iteration. Within the context of the for loop defined on line 3 in `reverse_function`, the local variable `string` is being reassigned to the concatenation of the current `char` + the current value of `string` in the current iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `string` is pointing at `\"hello\"` in memory, in the first execution of the loop, `string` is reassigned to the value of `char` (`h`) + `string` (`\"hello\"`), which results in `\"hhello\"`. This continues with each iteration, appending each character in `string` at the beginning and reassigning `string` to the result of this concatenation, ending with the value `ollehhello`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make this approach work, `string` needs to be reassigned to an empty string literal for the first interation of the for loop. In order to accomplish this, a conditional check needs to be used in conjunction with accessing the index of the character using `enumerate` in the loop definition, like this:"
