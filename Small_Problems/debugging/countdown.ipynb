    "The bug in this instance comes from the fact that Python is pass-by-object reference. `counter` is defined on line 4 in the global scope, and then passed into the `decrease` function, in the context of a for loop, on line 8. Since variables in python are pointers to objects, `counter` is specifically pointing to the integer value`10` somewhere in memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make things a more little confusing, the `decrease` function definition on line 1 has a single parameter, also named `counter`. In the context of `decrease`, the local variable `context` has the integer value 1 subtracted from it, and the result of this subtraction expression is returned, leading some to possibly _think_ that `counter` will now be pointing to an integer value that is one less than it was.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the global variable `counter` is passed as an argument to `decrease` on line 8, python behaves a bit like pass by value, since the object that counter is pointing to is an immutable type _(in this case, an integer)_. When the subtraction expression evaluates, a new integer value is returned on line 2, but `counter` continues to point to the same integer value in memory that it had before the subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fix for this is relativly straightforward. Using reassignment for `counter` on line 8, `decrease` will return the decreased integer value, and that will reassign the global `counter` variable to the decremented value."
